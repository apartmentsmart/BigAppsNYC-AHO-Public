[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-apps-template/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-apps-template#info=devDependencies)


## Dependencies

You'll need the following software installed to get started.

  - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer for your OS.
  - [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads): Use the installer for your OS.
    - Windows users can also try [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).
  - [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `npm install -g gulp bower`
    - Depending on how Node is configured on your machine, you may need to run `sudo npm install -g gulp bower` instead, if you get an error with the first command.

## Get Started

To run the app locally cd into the folder and run `foundation-apps watch`

## Adding New Files

**Anytime a new file is added kill the local server and restart it. Foundation now knows to watch the new files for changes.**
Developers work in the client folder and changes are automagically saved to the build directory.
